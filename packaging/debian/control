Description: Linux user management with GitHub organization/team (Zig implementation)
 octopass brings GitHub's team management to your Linux servers. No more
 manually managing /etc/passwd or distributing SSH keys - just add users
 to your GitHub team, and they're ready to SSH into your servers.
 .
 This is the Zig rewrite of the original C implementation with zero
 external dependencies beyond libc.
